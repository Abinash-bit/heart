## Inspiration
We first brainstormed on the topic and find out about Mohan foundation which does a work of bridging a gap between donor and recipient, hence we took inspiration from that and added our own features and methods. 

## What it does
HeartBeat is an website that helps recipients find its donors as well as provides the recipients with a database of organ and blood availability in different hospitals. Here recipients can make donation plea which can be seen by donors who are willing to donate.

## How we built it
We first through intensive discussion decided on a streamlined topic, which was quiet a task for us. Then we distributed the task. We decided upon and UI and made the front-end then integrated the backend for the donation plea to be visible to the user.

## Challenges we ran into
It was firstly a challenge to narrow down to a specific topic as organ donation is a vast topic. Then the second challenge that we faced are that we had to change the UI as the former UI was not according to the theme. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are really proud of the co-ordination and co-operation we worked with. We have really developed a lot from the previous hackathon. It was all worth it burning the mid-night oil.

## What we learned
Firstly we learnt to tackle the problem of many as many ideas were coming to our mind but we streamlined to a specific idea. Then we learnt CSS Flexbox concept and tried our best to present the best possible finished product 

## What's next for HeartBeat
If HeartBeat gets commercialized then it will do wonders as this app is for a noble cause and it really tries to help those who are in need and hopefully make this world a better place to live and flourish healthy lives.
